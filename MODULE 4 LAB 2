QUESTION 1)


QUESTION 2) You are an ancient Egyptian mathematician, and you have been tasked with representing the fraction 6/14 as a sum of unique unit fractions. You know that a unit fraction is a fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of a positive integer. You also know that the sum of any number of unit fractions is always a rational number.

Example:

The first step is to find the largest possible unit fraction that is less than or equal to 6/14. This fraction is 1/3. The remaining fraction is 6/14 - 1/3 = 4/42. The largest possible unit fraction that is less than or equal to 4/42 is 1/11. The remaining fraction is 4/42 - 1/11 = 1/231.

Therefore, the Egyptian fraction representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231.

Exercise-1

Input: 6 14

Output: 3 11 231

Exercise-2

Input: 3 4

Output: 2 4
--CODE 

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;
vector<int> egyptianFraction(int numerator, int denominator) {
    vector<int> result;

    while (numerator != 0) {
        int unitFractionDenominator = (denominator + numerator - 1) / numerator;  // Corrected ceiling division
        result.push_back(unitFractionDenominator);

        numerator = numerator * unitFractionDenominator - denominator;
        denominator = denominator * unitFractionDenominator;
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example 1
    int numerator1, denominator1;
    cin >> numerator1 >> denominator1;
    vector<int> result1 = egyptianFraction(numerator1, denominator1);
    for (int num : result1) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;


    return 0;
}
